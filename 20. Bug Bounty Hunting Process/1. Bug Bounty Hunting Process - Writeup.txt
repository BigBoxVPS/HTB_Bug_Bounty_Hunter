- If you are reading this, I know you are not looking for any solution because this is the end of our trip 

- I just want to say "Congratulation! After 20 modules (more than 250 sections) you made it". It took me 45 days to pass the course and make the writeup

- This is my honor to guide you guys. Again "You made it! Great job"

- Some last main points about bug bounty process:

    [+] Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope of the bug bounty program, including the systems, applications, and platforms that are in scope for testing.

    [+] Establish Rules and Guidelines: Set clear rules and guidelines for participants, including what types of vulnerabilities are eligible, what actions are allowed during testing, and any legal or ethical considerations.

    [+] Create a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP): Develop a VDP that outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities, including the preferred channels for reporting, expected response times, and the steps taken to address the reported issues.

    [+] Launch the Program: Announce the bug bounty program to the public through various channels, such as security forums, social media, and dedicated bug bounty platforms. Provide information about the program, including rewards, scope, and rules.

    [+] Test and Report: Participants conduct security testing on the systems within the defined scope. When they discover a vulnerability, they should follow the guidelines and report it according to the established process.

    [+] Verify and Prioritize: The organization's security team verifies the reported vulnerabilities to ensure their validity. They prioritize the issues based on their severity, impact, and likelihood of exploitation.

    [+] Reward and Recognition: Depending on the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability, the organization provides rewards to the participants. This may include monetary compensation, swag, or public recognition.

    [+] Resolve and Mitigate: The organization addresses the reported vulnerabilities by developing patches, fixes, or mitigations. They apply necessary security measures to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

    [+] Communicate and Update: Maintain open communication with the participants throughout the process, providing regular updates on the status of their reported vulnerabilities. Share information about resolved issues and lessons learned.

    [+] Learn and Improve: Continuously learn from the bug bounty program by analyzing the vulnerabilities discovered, understanding the root causes, and implementing necessary changes to enhance the overall security posture.

    [+] Promote Responsible Disclosure: Encourage responsible disclosure practices by acknowledging and rewarding researchers who report vulnerabilities outside of the bug bounty program. Foster a positive relationship with the security community.

    [+] Follow Legal and Ethical Standards: Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards throughout the bug bounty process, including protecting participant privacy and respecting the terms and conditions of the program.
